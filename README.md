 # This is my Portfolio which is space themed also inspired by WebChain Dev check out the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0siQoaXMmzk

 ### I made this portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and resume 

 To copy This project and use it on your device just do:
 
 git clone (project url)
 
 npm install 
 
 npm run dev

  You can edit the projects, resume, and skills by going to that section and editing it 
  To put your own picture or video just bring it from wherever you saved it to the public folder of the project
  Then remember the name and insert it on the src of the page or section you want to insert it in

  enjoy and thank you
